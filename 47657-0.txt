                                Report of
                       GOVERNOR'S REPRESENTATIVES
                             for California at
                    Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition


                                  SACRAMENTO, CAL., DECEMBER 27, 1910.

    _To Hon. James N. Gillett,
        Governor of California, and Ex-Officio Commissioner
            Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition._

_Dear Sir_:--

As your Representatives, charged with the details of California's
representation at the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition, held at Seattle,
Washington, from June 1st to October 15th, 1909, inclusive, we take
pleasure in submitting to you the following report of our work.

It was right that California should aid and participate in a Western
Exposition, and it was wise to make the appropriation for the purpose
sufficient to insure a creditable representation of the State's
resources. Accordingly, on your recommendation, the Legislature
of 1907, set apart from the General Fund the sum of $100,000,
and authorized you, as Commissioner for California, through such
Representatives as it might be your pleasure to appoint, to supervise
the general expenditure of the appropriation in the erection of a
suitable building on the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition grounds, and
the collection and installation therein of such an exhibit as would do
credit to the State, and exemplify in as striking and effective manner
as possible the great variety and superior quality of California's
products.


REPRESENTATIVES.

In accordance with the authority thus conferred it was your pleasure
to appoint the undersigned to represent you in this work. You acted
promptly and gave your Representatives ample time to take advantage of
the seasons to secure samples of everything necessary for a complete
display of the State's resources. To this one fact is due largely the
greater completeness of the Seattle exhibit than any California had
previously made. You also relieved your Representatives of possible
embarrassment by allowing them to appoint their own assistants and
fix their compensation and term of service. In the exercise of this
authority preference was given to those best qualified to perform the
work required, and the term of employment depended on efficiency and
good behavior. No help was hired that was not absolutely necessary,
and no one was kept on the pay-roll a moment longer than his or her
services were required. In short, it was our determined purpose from
the start to try and secure maximum results at a minimum cost in every
department of the work, to the end that the final outcome might be an
improvement on any previous effort made by California of a similar
character.

We considered this to be necessary, not only in deference to our own
reputation, but more particularly for the credit and benefit of the
State. You can understand if the display made at Seattle had been less
complete or in any way less attractive than the one made at Portland,
for instance, the impression created would be that those in charge were
becoming careless, or that California was retrograding, a condition
that would probably have resulted in as much harm as good, and largely
or entirely neutralized the object of the Legislature in making the
appropriation.


IMPROVEMENT IMPERATIVE.

We felt that we must improve on previous showings made by the State at
other Expositions, or resign and ask that the responsibility be placed
in other hands, or that the money be allowed to remain in the State
Treasury. With a larger appropriation, corresponding with the larger
expenditures in freight and numerous other items at Seattle as compared
to Portland, the effort for an improved display would not have been
difficult; but with the appropriation practically the same, considering
the salvage benefit realized for Portland from California's exhibit
the previous year at St. Louis, the planning, the economizing, the
denials and the extra personal labor imposed in order to accomplish
the desired result can never be fully appreciated, except by those
who had immediate charge of the work. Those efforts were made the
more difficult by reason of California's reputation for open handed
hospitality, and the ever present consciousness that nothing must
be done or left undone that might tend to impair that reputation.
You can understand it is no easy task to maintain a show of generous
hospitality all day, and then set up at night to figure out how you can
do the same thing to-morrow without unduly impairing a limited revenue.


BUILDING AND EXHIBITS SUPERIOR.

But we did it. We built the best and second largest State Building
ever erected at a World's Fair; we collected and installed the most
complete and most attractive exhibit of California's resources that the
State ever made; we maintained stereoptican lectures, gave out verbal
information to all inquirers, and distributed attractive literature;
we gave frequent receptions and dispensed true California hospitality;
we filled the measure of our aim; we did what we believe the State
expected us to do, and it is a proud moment now the work is ended and
we are able to record the fact that we did it without exceeding the
appropriation.


THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING.

The California building was of the Spanish renaissance style of
architecture. The broad steps that led up to the five large arches
which opened on to the wide portico or colonnade were eighty feet
long, and through any of the five broad doors that fronted the arches
visitors entered the main exhibition hall. This hall was one hundred
and forty feet square with gallery on all four sides twenty-one feet
high and thirty feet wide. Four flights of easy stairs, one at either
corner, led to the spacious gallery. Light was diffused from side
windows under the gallery and in the gallery high enough from the
floor so as not to interfere with the wall for exhibit purposes, and
from an iron-framed skylight sixty-four feet square. On either side
of the main building and in line with the front there were wings
thirty-two feet wide and thirty-five feet long. This gave a total
frontage to the building of two hundred and ten feet, or a little more
than two-thirds of an average city block. The wings were so arranged
as to provide a lecture hall, offices, parlor, reception room, buffet,
and living rooms for the Representatives and some of the employees.
The structure as a whole presented an imposing appearance and was
ideal for the purpose intended. It was designed and built by the State
Engineering Department, with an occasional inspection by one of the
Representatives. Builders figured on the plans and variously estimated
the cost at from $50,000 to $56,000. We had asked for a building to
cost not exceeding one-third of the appropriation. For a time we feared
the dimensions would have to be reduced, but State Engineer Ellery,
after figuring carefully on the job, expressed the opinion that he
could erect the structure as planned for an amount pretty close to our
figures. He was finally requested to go ahead with the work. He put one
of his trusted superintendents in charge, hired his help by the day,
and when completed as nearly as desired for exposition purposes, it was
found to have cost, including preparation of grounds and finishing of
lecture room, just $40,333.84, and it was better finished outside and
more substantially constructed than Exposition buildings usually are.


NOW A MUSEUM.

As you are aware it has been deeded to the Washington University, on
whose grounds the Exposition was held, and, barring accidents, will
remain for many years as the University Museum building.


THE GENERAL DISPLAY.

[Illustration: GENERAL VIEW, CALIFORNIA EXHIBIT, SEATTLE, 1909

Center Piece or Fruit Palace]

The installation would be tedious to describe, and we will not
attempt it further than to say that harmony in color and arrangement
was maintained throughout the building, all balancing from an imposing
center-piece, or Product Palace, which was covered entirely with
natural products of the State, including dried fruits, seeds, cereals,
raisins, nuts, etc., so artistically arranged as to give the whole a
very attractive appearance. This center-piece or palace was admitted
to be not only the most beautiful feature of the California Building,
but the most original, elaborate and artistic feature of the entire
Exposition. The editor of _Illustrated Northwest Farm and Home_
visited the California Building during the early part of the Fair, and
returning home gave expression to his impressions through the columns
of his paper in these words:

    "In the California Building there is everything to delight the eye
    and the entertainers can talk English. The statuary and ornaments
    in fruits and nuts surpasses anything that the eye of man ever
    beheld. For instance; the representation of carvings over the
    finished woods are created of various kinds of fruits; at the
    entrance to the center-piece within the main building, are two
    life-size mountain lions made of peaches; a black knight mounted
    on a black horse, are made of California prunes; an elephant, full
    size, is made of California walnuts; a life-size cow is created of
    California almonds; a large black bear has California raisins for
    a robe; a lemon as large as a hogshead, is composed of California
    lemons."

These were some of the fruit features designed to set off the general
display and emphasize the products that composed them. But these
were only incidental to the strong and imposing exhibit of all of
California's material products. There was a generous display of
processed fruits, including all varieties known to the State. The
dried fruit department was strong and attractive, embracing three
separate features, one of miscellaneous dried fruits, one of raisins
and one of prunes. There were separate stands or features of wines,
olive oil, pickled olives, mineral water, canned fruit, preserved
fruit, vegetables, flowers, oranges, nuts, honey, beans, cereals,
seeds, sugar, silk, wool, ostrich feathers, fibers, canned milk, canned
fish, etc., etc., besides many suitable show cases containing samples
of other products more delicate and less in quantity. There was a
strong show of incubators and an attractive feature of borax. Models
were shown, and in operation where practicable, of such articles or
machinery as could not be accommodated otherwise, as for instance the
working model of a complete gold dredge, manufactured especially for
this exhibit by the Risdon Iron Works of San Francisco.


MINING EXHIBIT.

The Mining Department of the display on the main floor of the
California Building was attractively installed and as complete as the
State has ever made, being strong in the minerals in which we are
strong, but embracing in all forty-four separate commercial varieties,
including a strong showing of mineral oils and structural materials. A
beautiful illuminated case of gold specimens and free gold ores from
Siskiyou County, and an equally beautiful illuminated case of rough and
cut gems from San Diego County, including gem jewelry, constituted very
attractive features of the mineral department. The onyx and onyx ware
from San Diego made a fine showing, as did also the large display of
slate in all forms of utility from El Dorado.


FORESTRY.

The Forestry Department included all the commercial woods of the
State and many that have a prospective value for cabinet purposes.
The variety displayed in this feature was so great, the installation
so attractive, and the quality of the raw and manufactured samples
so superior, that the Jury readily awarded to it a Grand Prize, the
highest recognition possible, and this in a State where forestry is a
leading industry, and by a Jury composed largely of Washingtonians.
This was a victory to be proud of. All the available space on the
walls of the main exhibition hall was covered with enlarged views of
California scenes and industries.


THE GALLERY.

[Illustration: SECTION OF ART GALLERY, CALIFORNIA EXHIBIT, SEATTLE,
1909]

On the upper floor, one gallery (the front) was reserved for display
pictures, a hotel information bureau and receptions, one for an exhibit
of manufacturers' samples, one for Art, and one for Education.


THE MANUFACTURERS' SAMPLES,

while largely a new departure, constituted a very interesting and
instructive feature. Even many Californians were surprised to learn
that all of the articles found there were made in this State. Leather
and leather goods, silk and silk fabrics and nautical instruments in
this department, each were awarded the highest prize it was possible to
obtain.


FINE ARTS.

The Art Display collected largely by Miss Evelyn Almond Withrow of
San Francisco, as a labor of love, her services being gratuitous, as
was her time in superintending the installation of the exhibit later,
was freely admitted by those informed on such things to be the best
and most complete representation of California art and handicraft ever
brought together on any previous occasion either at home or abroad. It
comprised nearly three hundred pictures, all the best work of the best
artists in the State, besides busts of statuary, samples of modeling
and eight large and specially designed show cases filled with beautiful
samples of all classes of handiwork known to art.


EDUCATION.

Our Educational Display was the best and most complete ever made, and
was very much the best exhibit of the kind at the Seattle Exposition.
It was collected and superintended by Mr. Robert Furlong of San Rafael,
an expert in this line of work, and embraced a representative showing
of every department of California's educational system from the
kindergarten to the university, not omitting the libraries and private
educational institutions. There could be only one criticism to this
department and that was its crowded condition, as there was too much
material for the space that could be allowed for it. In an exhibit of
products, quantity can be reduced without material detriment, but if
one sample of an educational exhibit is left out, the work perhaps of
some fond son or daughter whose parents may come looking for it, there
is likely to be trouble. Nearly all portions of California contributed
to this Department, making the display representative in every sense.


OUR LOCATION AND GROUNDS.

The California building, though some distance back from the main
entrance, was on high ground and eligibly located as to attractive
surroundings and accessibility. The grounds for so large a structure
were necessarily extensive, and the work of clearing, leveling, sodding
and planting these grounds involved an expenditure much greater than at
previous expositions, where the grounds were smaller and required less
preparatory work.

Mr. Geo. C. Roeding of Fresno, our Superintendent of Horticulture,
giving his talents and time, as did Miss Withrow, for the love of the
work and the good he could do the State, collected from different
nurseries in California two car loads of fruiting trees, flowering
plants, palms and shrubs, and traveled to Seattle to personally
superintend the work of converting these grounds into a typical
California park, with clusters of palms, geranium beds and orange
groves. It gave to the Exposition a semi-tropic feature which visitors
greatly enjoyed, and which was highly appreciated by the Exposition
management as a rare and valuable acquisition to their already
beautiful landscape effects. It might be said, however, that the citrus
trees and other tender plants did not thrive well even in the Seattle
summer, and though the grounds thus planted, as a side attraction and
subject of favorable comment, were perhaps worth all they cost, yet
they were not so beautiful as they would have been under more favorable
climatic conditions. Mr. Roeding's work in the department was prompted
by love of his art and pride in his State. He contributed liberally
from his own nurseries and gave time and technical assistance that
money could hardly have bought, and for his unstinted services, not
only your Representatives, but all Californians, owe him a debt of
lasting gratitude.


COUNTY AID.

Striving to obtain the best exhibit possible with the means
available, your Representatives early solicited the co-operation of
all the counties of California, offering in return for their efforts
such distinctive representation as the merits of their respective
products would warrant, consistent with a general harmonious plan of
installation. Some responded very generously, others modestly and some
not at all. On the whole, however, the help from counties was very
material, particularly the services of their respective representatives
in entertaining visitors to the California building and answering the
constant flow of questions provoked by an inspection of the exhibits.
Those counties that supported one or more representatives at the
Exposition and which contributed more or less to the general display
were, San Diego, Los Angeles, Riverside, Ventura, Santa Barbara,
Santa Cruz, Alameda, San Francisco, Tulare, Sacramento and Siskiyou.
Material was contributed by Kern, Fresno, San Joaquin, Monterey,
Santa Clara, and here and there a little from others, but none of
these latter maintained a representative, while some of those first
named had at least two people with us all the time. It can be readily
understood that with the regular State employees, reenforced by all
the county representatives indicated, selected generally by reason of
their especial qualifications for the position, the California force
was very strong, and if any one visited the building and left without
learning all he or she wanted to know about our State, or any part
or industry thereof, it was because they did not make the desire for
such information known. The work of the able floor representatives and
lecturers was strongly reenforced by a well equipped


LITERATURE BUREAU.

A neat booth with spacious counter was provided at a prominent and
convenient place in the building and well supplied with attractive
literature all the time, free to all comers. In addition to the State
book, a large edition of which was compiled and published at the
expense of the appropriation, and which, we desire to say here, was
as comprehensive a publication on California as was ever gotten out,
nearly every progressive county contributed to the supply, thus making
it possible to meet the eager demand that always exists for information
regarding this State. Altogether from first to last we estimate that
more than a car load of literature was handed out from our literature
booth or given to visitors by those on the floor, and yet no one was
ever asked to take a line who had not previously expressed a desire
for it. If you force literature on people much of it is thrown away
as soon as they are out of your sight. If put within convenient reach
people take what they want and no more, and what they want they keep.
No California literature was thrown away.

[Illustration: GENERAL VIEW, CALIFORNIA EXHIBIT, SEATTLE, 1909]


THE FREE ILLUSTRATED LECTURES

were a strong reenforcement to the literature. These lectures were
given by the different County Representatives in a hall built and
equipped by the State especially for the purpose, and which opened
off the main exhibition room. The number of lectures varied from nine
to twelve a day, each occupying half an hour, twenty-five minutes for
the talk and five minutes to empty and re-fill the hall. They were a
popular feature and always well patronized, and their far-reaching and
convincing lessons will be realized in benefits to California, and
especially to the sections represented, for many years to come. A new
departure in Exposition work was the maintenance in the California
building of a California


HOTEL INFORMATION BUREAU.

Room and accommodations were gladly given for this feature, which,
however, was maintained at the expense of certain contributing hotels
that represented practically all important centers of the State. It
relieved your Representatives of the duty of supplying information in
this particular line of inquiry and insured the work being done better
than it could have been otherwise.


DEMONSTRATING BOOTHS

were maintained in the California Building by a number of exhibitors
to whom we were pleased to give space for the purpose, as experience
teaches that one of the most effective ways of impressing the merits of
any particular article is to prove its value by sample. Our preserved
fruits, our canned mackerel and our borax products were shown and
sampled from artistic booths, while beans, wine, olive oil and other
products were demonstrated as occasion required but in a more modest
way.


HOSTESSES.

Mrs. Wiggins and Mrs. Filcher who had served so successfully as
hostesses at the St. Louis Exposition and at the Portland Exposition,
were installed as hostesses of the California Building at Seattle, the
compensation to be determined after the close of the Exposition when
our financial condition would be better understood, they agreeing in
advance to abide by the outcome. This arrangement was an incentive
to extra economy on their part, and it may be said they seconded
every effort of your Representatives in that direction, and yet they
maintained California's reputation for hospitality admirably, and
became favorites in the large Hostesses' Association of the Exposition,
of which Mrs. Wiggins was one of the leading officials.


SECRETARY.

Mr. Geo. A. Dennison, who had a long prior record with the State Board
of Trade, and who served us so efficiently as Secretary at St. Louis
and at Portland, was appointed Secretary at Seattle, and remained with
us to the close of our work. In this connection it may be said that
other State Representatives had as their office force a secretary,
a bookkeeper and a stenographer. Mr. Dennison, possessing the
qualifications, filled all three of those positions for California, and
being an expert in each branch filled them all with marked efficiency.


ATTENDANCE.

The splendid exhibit made by California proved one of the principal
attractions of the Exposition. It became to be the general remark
that if you did not see the Government exhibit and the California
exhibit you did not see the show. As a consequence all who attended the
Exposition visited the California building, and as may be supposed, we
had a crowd passing through the exhibits all the time the building was
open. The average attendance at the Exposition was close to 25,000 a
day; allowing that each visitor spent two days on the grounds, and that
in one of the two days practically all visited our building, it may be
estimated that the number who inspected the California exhibits daily
was about 12,000. This we believe is a fair estimate.


CALIFORNIA VISITORS.

We had a separate card register for visitors from this State, and it
will surprise you perhaps to learn that the number of Californians who
registered with us averaged nearly two hundred a day, or twelve hundred
a week. In one day during the height of the season we registered
372 people from our home State. It is not only possible, but very
probable, that many come and went without registering; making allowance
for these, and figuring those who did register at 1,200 a week, and
counting twenty weeks for the Fair (19 weeks and 5 days to be exact),
we estimate the number of Californians who attended the Seattle
Exposition at 25,000.


AWARDS.

If other evidence were wanting to establish the claim that the Seattle
exhibit was the best and most complete ever made by California, it
would be found in the record of prizes won by this State. In proportion
to the number of entries we not only beat all the other States in the
number of high awards, but we beat all past records made by California,
and this in face of the fact that the juries as a rule set a high
standard and were very critical in their examinations. California's
greatest total premiums at any previous Exposition was 518, while at
Seattle the total was 800. To win gold medals or higher on half the
entries is considered a remarkable record, and yet out of the total of
800 at Seattle, 90 were grand prizes, an award only made in case of
extraordinary excellence, 414 were gold medals, 155 silver medals, 108
bronze medals and 33 honorable mentions. A careful analysis by one who
understands what is required to win a high award at an International
Exposition and what it stands for, will show at once that this is
a most extraordinary record, one which we confidently believe has
never been equalled by any State or country at any Exposition in the
world, and one which is not likely to be equalled except possibly by
California itself, for many years to come. It will be noticed from
the detailed list of the awards, which follows in this report, that
they are well distributed throughout the State, nearly every locality
and every industry sharing in the honors, a further evidence of the
representative character of the exhibit.


SALVAGE.

At the close of the Exposition we took sufficient time to safely pack
all material that had to be returned and to label it carefully so as
to facilitate its distribution in California. In the meantime we sold
some of the edible goods and some on order we turned over to local
agents of the owners. All money received therefor has been remitted
to the parties who furnished the articles and receipts received for
the same. The furniture, fixtures and other material which belonged to
the State and which we deemed it advisable to sell, was disposed of to
the best advantage possible, considering the great quantity of this
class of goods that were being thrown on the market. From this source
we realized the sum of $5,135.16. From rent of soft drink stand in the
building we realized the sum of $300.00, and from the sale of building
$750.00, making the total salvage exclusive of building $5,435.16,
which is fully accounted for in the financial statement which follows
in this report. The $750.00 received for the building was turned over
to the State Printer on account and never passed through our hands.

[Illustration: THE ALMOND COW, LIFE SIZE, CALIFORNIA EXHIBIT, SEATTLE,
1909]


MATERIAL ON HAND.

There was certain office furniture which it was deemed unwise to
sacrifice, and some permanent exhibition material that is worth more to
the State for future expositions than any amount that could be realized
from it at a forced sale. Consequently this material was returned and
the furniture has been turned over to the State Agricultural Society
and the exhibition material has been stored in a shed which we built
for the purpose on the grounds of the State Agricultural Society. The
latter consists of eight mineral show cases, a collection of California
ores and mineral specimens, a large assortment of California woods,
including burls and rare specimens, a lot of framed and unframed
pictures of California scenes and industries, and about 500 glass
jars, most of which are filled with seeds, cereals, sugar or processed
fruits. The furniture returned at 50 cents on the dollar, the usual
selling price at an Exposition of good material, is worth $75.00,
the showcases $425.00, exhibit material, estimated at half what it
would cost to collect it, $2,000.00, and the glass jars $1,000.00.
This totals a heritage to the State from the Seattle Exposition of
$3,500.00. This will be available and worth even more than the sum
stated whenever the State desires to make another exhibition.


BENEFITS TO CALIFORNIA.

Summing up the benefits of an exhibit is a good deal like a merchant
trying to estimate the good derived from a sign over his door.
Occasionally a patron may say, "I saw your sign and came in," and
occasionally a party may say, "I saw your exhibit and it prompted me
to come to California." The money dropped from travelers alone who
passed through this State going to or returning from the Exposition,
has probably recompensed California for its outlay, but this is only
the beginning of the harvest. Many people from the eastern and central
States who visited the Exposition with a view of ascertaining in which
part of the Northwest it would be best to settle, changed their minds
after seeing the exhibits made by the different States and came on
to California. Besides, thousands of others already settled, after
inspecting the exhibits made by this State, openly declared that if
they ever moved again they would land in California. The tons of
literature on this State carried away by visitors to supplement and
strengthen their impressions, both impressions and literature to be
disseminated among their neighbors, will have an effect that cannot
be estimated, but which must inevitably bear fruit for California for
many years to come. Then again, the seeing of our splendid products
naturally excites a desire to try them, and the increased demand
for our fruits, oil, wines, etc., growing out of such a display, is
far-reaching. But more than all this, the greater intercourse, the
better acquaintance, the more friendly feeling between the people of
the different sections of the country, and particularly of the west,
and more particularly between the people of this State and Washington,
or Oregon and Washington, if you please, is bound to lead to a better
understanding in regard to trade relations and result in commercial
benefits that cannot be estimated. That the participation of California
was wise there is no doubt, and that the benefits received and to
be received will be many fold greater than the cost is as certain
as the future. The follow-up letters that have already come to your
Representatives from people of the Northwest and other sections who saw
and inspected our exhibit, is further proof that an interest in this
State has been awakened among them that will not soon die out.


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.

We are under obligations to so many that it would be tedious to
enumerate them. The higher officials of the Exposition, President J.
E. Chilberg, Director-General I. A. Nadeau and Director of Exhibits H.
E. Dosch, showed us every courtesy and manifested a desire to do all
they could to facilitate our work; while from the other departments,
and even from the subordinates in all departments, a request from
California was promptly considered and always conceded when not
inconsistent with the Exposition rules. There were differences at
first, as is always the case, but on a better understanding these were
adjusted to the satisfaction of all concerned.

[Illustration: WALNUT ELEPHANT, LIFE SIZE, CALIFORNIA EXHIBIT, SEATTLE,
1909]

The Southern Pacific Company and the Northern Pacific Company carried
our freight at a one-way rate, and their respective agents were prompt
and accommodating, setting a new mark for railroad efficiency at
Expositions. The Southern Pacific Passenger Department also loaned us
some very fine pictures of California scenes which were valuable not
only as wall decorations but as object lessons on certain features of
our State. To the Golden Gate Park officials of San Francisco, and also
the officials of the Stockton State Hospital, we are under obligations
for liberal contributions of ornamental plants and shrubs for the
decoration of the California building and grounds. Mr. R. M. Teague of
San Dimas and the Fancher Creek Nursery of Fresno, also contributed
liberally of their choicest stock, for which we owe them a debt of
gratitude. The same is true of J. Dietrich, Howard & Smith, Elysian
Park and Edward H. Rust, all of Los Angeles, and of the Orange County
Nursery & Land Co., of Fullerton.

To the counties and other subdivisions of the State that through
organized effort and at their own expense collected valuable exhibition
material, prepared descriptive literature and sent representatives to
Seattle, thereby strengthening the exhibit and adding to the force of
California workers, we are under obligations. To their efforts and to
the efficiency of the people they sent much of California's success at
the Seattle Exposition is due, and we want them to know and feel that
their efforts and co-operation are fully appreciated.

To producers, manufacturers and packers, to lumbermen and miners, who
responded to our request for samples of their output we owe a debt
which we tried to pay in part by caring for their goods as they would
have cared for them, and by looking out for their interests in the
matter of awards as carefully as they could have done had they been
there.

In this connection we wish to express our obligation to the Niles-Pease
Furniture Company for the generous loan of the finest art mission
furniture for our reception room, to Byron Mauzy of San Francisco, the
Star Piano Company and Salyer-Baumeister of Los Angeles, for the loan
of pianos for the use of our guests, and to the Eilers Piano Company
for the free use of a pianola for our lecture room. To Arthur Harris,
designer, and to C. L. Wilson, Superintendent of Installation, both
experts in their line, is due largely the attractive character of
California's exhibit, admitted to be the most beautiful in arrangement
and display, as well as the most comprehensive ever put up by this or
any other State, at Seattle or any other Exposition.


CONCLUSION.

We do not hesitate to affirm that California's participation at the
Seattle Exposition was a success from every point of view, and knowing
our trust was conscientiously performed, and that our best efforts
were exerted in the interest of our State, we dare to hope that you
who trusted us are not disappointed, and that the people of California
who generously advanced the money for the work are satisfied with
the showing made, and that they will reap substantial and lasting
benefit as the result of their enterprise and liberality. We want to
thank you sincerely for the confidence reposed in us, for your kindly
co-operation and advise, and particularly for the generous rein given
to us in carrying out a work for which you, in the eyes of the law,
were primarily responsible. Our studied efforts were continually
directed toward trying to get the greatest results at the least cost,
for, though handling a generous appropriation, we never lost sight of
the fact that it was the people's money, and consequently we consented
to the expenditure of a dollar only where in our judgement a dollar's
worth or more benefit would accrue to California; neither did we lose
sight of the high standard which has characterized your course in the
handling of public affairs. We acted on the principle that public
office is a public trust, and that public money should be handled with
greater care than one would handle his own.

The following pages contain a complete list of the awards made to
California exhibitors and a statement of all moneys received and
expended, and accompanying this report we hand you the vouchers showing
all our transactions and just how the money was expended. We have
settled every honorable claim, we have concluded the work in full, even
to the distribution of the awards, and if there is a dollar left to go
back into the Treasury it is because that dollar was not needed for the
full satisfaction of the duties imposed.

                                   Respectfully,
                                         J. A. FILCHER,
                                         FRANK WIGGINS,
                                             Governor's Representatives.
