for California at<br />
Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition<br />
</h2>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="right noindent"><span class="smcap">Sacramento, Cal., December 27, 1910.</span></p>

<p class="noindent"><i>To Hon. James N. Gillett,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Governor of California, and Ex-Officio Commissioner</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition.</span></i></p>

<p class="noindent"><i>Dear Sir</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>As your Representatives, charged with the details of California&rsquo;s
representation at the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition, held at Seattle,
Washington, from June 1st to October 15th, 1909, inclusive, we take
pleasure in submitting to you the following report of our work.</p>

<p>It was right that California should aid and participate in a Western
Exposition, and it was wise to make the appropriation for the purpose
sufficient to insure a creditable representation of the State&rsquo;s resources.
Accordingly, on your recommendation, the Legislature of 1907, set
apart from the General Fund the sum of $100,000, and authorized you,
as Commissioner for California, through such Representatives as it might
be your pleasure to appoint, to supervise the general expenditure of the
appropriation in the erection of a suitable building on the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific
Exposition grounds, and the collection and installation
therein of such an exhibit as would do credit to the State, and exemplify
in as striking and effective manner as possible the great variety
and superior quality of California&rsquo;s products.</p>


<h3>REPRESENTATIVES.</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>In accordance with the authority thus conferred it was your pleasure
to appoint the undersigned to represent you in this work. You acted
promptly and gave your Representatives ample time to take advantage
of the seasons to secure samples of everything necessary for a
complete display of the State&rsquo;s resources. To this one fact is due
largely the greater completeness of the Seattle exhibit than any California
had previously made. You also relieved your Representatives
of possible embarrassment by allowing them to appoint their own
assistants and fix their compensation and term of service. In the exercise
of this authority preference was given to those best qualified to
perform the work required, and the term of employment depended on
efficiency and good behavior. No help was hired that was not absolutely
necessary, and no one was kept on the pay-roll a moment longer
than his or her services were required. In short, it was our determined
purpose from the start to try and secure maximum results at a minimum
cost in every department of the work, to the end that the final
outcome might be an improvement on any previous effort made by
California of a similar character.</p>

<p>We considered this to be necessary, not only in deference to our
own reputation, but more particularly for the credit and benefit of the
State. You can understand if the display made at Seattle had been
less complete or in any way less attractive than the one made at
Portland, for instance, the impression created would be that those in
charge were becoming careless, or that California was retrograding, a
condition that would probably have resulted in as much harm as good,
and largely or entirely neutralized the object of the Legislature in
making the appropriation.</p>


<h3>IMPROVEMENT IMPERATIVE.</h3>

<p>We felt that we must improve on previous showings made by the
State at other Expositions, or resign and ask that the responsibility be
placed in other hands, or that the money be allowed to remain in the
State Treasury. With a larger appropriation, corresponding with the
larger expenditures in freight and numerous other items at Seattle as
compared to Portland, the effort for an improved display would not
have been difficult; but with the appropriation practically the same,
considering the salvage benefit realized for Portland from California&rsquo;s
exhibit the previous year at St. Louis, the planning, the economizing,
the denials and the extra personal labor imposed in order to accomplish
the desired result can never be fully appreciated, except by those who
had immediate charge of the work. Those efforts were made the more
difficult by reason of California&rsquo;s reputation for open handed hospitality,
and the ever present consciousness that nothing must be done or
left undone that might tend to impair that reputation. You can understand
it is no easy task to maintain a show of generous hospitality all
day, and then set up at night to figure out how you can do the same
thing to-morrow without unduly impairing a limited revenue.</p>


<h3>BUILDING AND EXHIBITS SUPERIOR.</h3>

<p>But we did it. We built the best and second largest State Building
ever erected at a World&rsquo;s Fair; we collected and installed the most
complete and most attractive exhibit of California&rsquo;s resources that the
State ever made; we maintained stereoptican lectures, gave out verbal
information to all inquirers, and distributed attractive literature; we
gave frequent receptions and dispensed true California hospitality; we
filled the measure of our aim; we did what we believe the State expected
us to do, and it is a proud moment now the work is ended and
we are able to record the fact that we did it without exceeding the
appropriation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING.</h3>

<p>The California building was of the Spanish renaissance style of
architecture. The broad steps that led up to the five large arches
which opened on to the wide portico or colonnade were eighty feet long,
and through any of the five broad doors that fronted the arches visitors
entered the main exhibition hall. This hall was one hundred and forty
feet square with gallery on all four sides twenty-one feet high and
thirty feet wide. Four flights of easy stairs, one at either corner, led
to the spacious gallery. Light was diffused from side windows under
the gallery and in the gallery high enough from the floor so as not to
interfere with the wall for exhibit purposes, and from an iron-framed
skylight sixty-four feet square. On either side of the main building
and in line with the front there were wings thirty-two feet wide and
thirty-five feet long. This gave a total frontage to the building of two
hundred and ten feet, or a little more than two-thirds of an average city
block. The wings were so arranged as to provide a lecture hall, offices,
parlor, reception room, buffet, and living rooms for the Representatives
and some of the employees. The structure as a whole presented an
imposing appearance and was ideal for the purpose intended. It was
designed and built by the State Engineering Department, with an
occasional inspection by one of the Representatives. Builders figured
on the plans and variously estimated the cost at from $50,000 to $56,000.
We had asked for a building to cost not exceeding one-third of the
appropriation. For a time we feared the dimensions would have to be
reduced, but State Engineer Ellery, after figuring carefully on the job,
expressed the opinion that he could erect the structure as planned for
an amount pretty close to our figures. He was finally requested to go
ahead with the work. He put one of his trusted superintendents in
charge, hired his help by the day, and when completed as nearly as
desired for exposition purposes, it was found to have cost, including
preparation of grounds and finishing of lecture room, just $40,333.84,
and it was better finished outside and more substantially constructed
than Exposition buildings usually are.</p>


<h3>NOW A MUSEUM.</h3>

<p>As you are aware it has been deeded to the Washington University,
on whose grounds the Exposition was held, and, barring accidents, will
remain for many years as the University Museum building.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;">

<p class="caption">GENERAL VIEW, CALIFORNIA EXHIBIT, SEATTLE, 1909<br />
Center Piece or Fruit Palace</p>
</div>

<h3>THE GENERAL DISPLAY.</h3>

<p>The installation would be tedious to describe, and we will not
attempt it further than to say that harmony in color and arrangement
was maintained throughout the building, all balancing from an imposing
center-piece, or Product Palace, which was covered entirely with
natural products of the State, including dried fruits, seeds, cereals,
raisins, nuts, etc., so artistically arranged as to give the whole a very
attractive appearance. This center-piece or palace was admitted to be
not only the most beautiful feature of the California Building, but the
most original, elaborate and artistic feature of the entire Exposition.
The editor of <i>Illustrated Northwest Farm and Home</i> visited the California<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
Building during the early part of the Fair, and returning home
gave expression to his impressions through the columns of his paper
in these words:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>&ldquo;In the California Building there is everything to delight the eye and the
entertainers can talk English. The statuary and ornaments in fruits and nuts
surpasses anything that the eye of man ever beheld. For instance; the representation
of carvings over the finished woods are created of various kinds of
fruits; at the entrance to the center-piece within the main building, are two
life-size mountain lions made of peaches; a black knight mounted on a black
horse, are made of California prunes; an elephant, full size, is made of California
walnuts; a life-size cow is created of California almonds; a large black
bear has California raisins for a robe; a lemon as large as a hogshead, is composed
of California lemons.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>These were some of the fruit features designed to set off the general
display and emphasize the products that composed them. But these
were only incidental to the strong and imposing exhibit of all of California&rsquo;s
material products. There was a generous display of processed
fruits, including all varieties known to the State. The dried fruit department
was strong and attractive, embracing three separate features,
one of miscellaneous dried fruits, one of raisins and one of prunes.
There were separate stands or features of wines, olive oil, pickled olives,
mineral water, canned fruit, preserved fruit, vegetables, flowers, oranges,
nuts, honey, beans, cereals, seeds, sugar, silk, wool, ostrich feathers,
fibers, canned milk, canned fish, etc., etc., besides many suitable show
cases containing samples of other products more delicate and less in
quantity. There was a strong show of incubators and an attractive
feature of borax. Models were shown, and in operation where practicable,
of such articles or machinery as could not be accommodated
otherwise, as for instance the working model of a complete gold dredge,
manufactured especially for this exhibit by the Risdon Iron Works of
San Francisco.</p>


<h3>MINING EXHIBIT.</h3>

<p>The Mining Department of the display on the main floor of the
California Building was attractively installed and as complete as the
State has ever made, being strong in the minerals in which we are
strong, but embracing in all forty-four separate commercial varieties,
including a strong showing of mineral oils and structural materials. A
beautiful illuminated case of gold specimens and free gold ores from
Siskiyou County, and an equally beautiful illuminated case of rough
and cut gems from San Diego County, including gem jewelry, constituted
very attractive features of the mineral department. The onyx
and onyx ware from San Diego made a fine showing, as did also the
large display of slate in all forms of utility from El Dorado.</p>


<h3>FORESTRY.</h3>

<p>The Forestry Department included all the commercial woods of the
State and many that have a prospective value for cabinet purposes.
The variety displayed in this feature was so great, the installation so
attractive, and the quality of the raw and manufactured samples so
superior, that the Jury readily awarded to it a Grand Prize, the highest
recognition possible, and this in a State where forestry is a leading industry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
and by a Jury composed largely of Washingtonians. This was
a victory to be proud of. All the available space on the walls of the
main exhibition hall was covered with enlarged views of California
scenes and industries.</p>


<h3>THE GALLERY.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;">
<img src="images/f003.jpg" width="650" height="502" alt="SECTION OF ART GALLERY, CALIFORNIA EXHIBIT, SEATTLE, 1909" />
<p class="caption">SECTION OF ART GALLERY, CALIFORNIA EXHIBIT, SEATTLE, 1909</p>
</div>

<p>On the upper floor, one gallery (the front) was reserved for display
pictures, a hotel information bureau and receptions, one for an exhibit
of manufacturers&rsquo; samples, one for Art, and one for Education.</p>


<h3>THE MANUFACTURERS&rsquo; SAMPLES,</h3>

<p class="noindent">while largely a new departure, constituted a very interesting and instructive
feature. Even many Californians were surprised to learn
that all of the articles found there were made in this State. Leather
and leather goods, silk and silk fabrics and nautical instruments in this
department, each were awarded the highest prize it was possible to
obtain.</p>


<h3>FINE ARTS.</h3>

<p>The Art Display collected largely by Miss Evelyn Almond Withrow
of San Francisco, as a labor of love, her services being gratuitous, as
was her time in superintending the installation of the exhibit later, was
freely admitted by those informed on such things to be the best and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
most complete representation of California art and handicraft ever
brought together on any previous occasion either at home or abroad.
It comprised nearly three hundred pictures, all the best work of the
best artists in the State, besides busts of statuary, samples of modeling
and eight large and specially designed show cases filled with beautiful
samples of all classes of handiwork known to art.</p>


<h3>EDUCATION.</h3>

<p>Our Educational Display was the best and most complete ever made,
and was very much the best exhibit of the kind at the Seattle Exposition.
It was collected and superintended by Mr. Robert Furlong of
San Rafael, an expert in this line of work, and embraced a representative
showing of every department of California&rsquo;s educational system
from the kindergarten to the university, not omitting the libraries and
private educational institutions. There could be only one criticism to
this department and that was its crowded condition, as there was too
much material for the space that could be allowed for it. In an exhibit
of products, quantity can be reduced without material detriment, but if
one sample of an educational exhibit is left out, the work perhaps of
some fond son or daughter whose parents may come looking for it,
there is likely to be trouble. Nearly all portions of California contributed
to this Department, making the display representative in every
sense.</p>


<h3>OUR LOCATION AND GROUNDS.</h3>

<p>The California building, though some distance back from the main
entrance, was on high ground and eligibly located as to attractive
surroundings and accessibility. The grounds for so large a structure
were necessarily extensive, and the work of clearing, leveling, sodding
and planting these grounds involved an expenditure much greater than
at previous expositions, where the grounds were smaller and required
less preparatory work.</p>

<p>Mr. Geo. C. Roeding of Fresno, our Superintendent of Horticulture,
giving his talents and time, as did Miss Withrow, for the love of the
work and the good he could do the State, collected from different
nurseries in California two car loads of fruiting trees, flowering plants,
palms and shrubs, and traveled to Seattle to personally superintend the
work of converting these grounds into a typical California park, with
clusters of palms, geranium beds and orange groves. It gave to the
Exposition a semi-tropic feature which visitors greatly enjoyed, and
which was highly appreciated by the Exposition management as a rare
and valuable acquisition to their already beautiful landscape effects.
It might be said, however, that the citrus trees and other tender plants
did not thrive well even in the Seattle summer, and though the grounds
thus planted, as a side attraction and subject of favorable comment, were
perhaps worth all they cost, yet they were not so beautiful as they would
have been under more favorable climatic conditions. Mr. Roeding&rsquo;s
work in the department was prompted by love of his art and pride in
his State. He contributed liberally from his own nurseries and gave
time and technical assistance that money could hardly have bought,
and for his unstinted services, not only your Representatives, but all
Californians, owe him a debt of lasting gratitude.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>


<h3>COUNTY AID.</h3>

<p>Striving to obtain the best exhibit possible with the means available,
your Representatives early solicited the co-operation of all the counties
of California, offering in return for their efforts such distinctive representation
as the merits of their respective products would warrant, consistent
with a general harmonious plan of installation. Some responded
very generously, others modestly and some not at all. On the whole,
however, the help from counties was very material, particularly the
services of their respective representatives in entertaining visitors to
the California building and answering the constant flow of questions
provoked by an inspection of the exhibits. Those counties that supported
one or more representatives at the Exposition and which contributed
more or less to the general display were, San Diego, Los Angeles,
Riverside, Ventura, Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz, Alameda, San Francisco,
Tulare, Sacramento and Siskiyou. Material was contributed by Kern,
Fresno, San Joaquin, Monterey, Santa Clara, and here and there a
little from others, but none of these latter maintained a representative,
while some of those first named had at least two people with us all the
time. It can be readily understood that with the regular State employees,
reenforced by all the county representatives indicated, selected
generally by reason of their especial qualifications for the position, the
California force was very strong, and if any one visited the building and
left without learning all he or she wanted to know about our State, or
any part or industry thereof, it was because they did not make the
desire for such information known. The work of the able floor representatives
and lecturers was strongly reenforced by a well equipped</p>


<h3>LITERATURE BUREAU.</h3>

<p>A neat booth with spacious counter was provided at a prominent
and convenient place in the building and well supplied with attractive
literature all the time, free to all comers. In addition to the State
book, a large edition of which was compiled and published at the
expense of the appropriation, and which, we desire to say here, was as
comprehensive a publication on California as was ever gotten out, nearly
every progressive county contributed to the supply, thus making it
possible to meet the eager demand that always exists for information
regarding this State. Altogether from first to last we estimate that
more than a car load of literature was handed out from our literature
booth or given to visitors by those on the floor, and yet no one was ever
asked to take a line who had not previously expressed a desire for it.
If you force literature on people much of it is thrown away as soon as
they are out of your sight. If put within convenient reach people
take what they want and no more, and what they want they keep. No
California literature was thrown away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p class="caption">GENERAL VIEW, CALIFORNIA EXHIBIT, SEATTLE, 1909</p>
</div>


<h3>THE FREE ILLUSTRATED LECTURES</h3>

<p class="noindent">were a strong reenforcement to the literature. These lectures were
given by the different County Representatives in a hall built and
equipped by the State especially for the purpose, and which opened off
the main exhibition room. The number of lectures varied from nine to
twelve a day, each occupying half an hour, twenty-five minutes for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
talk and five minutes to empty and re-fill the hall. They were a popular
feature and always well patronized, and their far-reaching and
convincing lessons will be realized in benefits to California, and especially
to the sections represented, for many years to come. A new
departure in Exposition work was the maintenance in the California
building of a California</p>


<h3>HOTEL INFORMATION BUREAU.</h3>

<p>Room and accommodations were gladly given for this feature, which,
however, was maintained at the expense of certain contributing hotels
that represented practically all important centers of the State. It relieved
your Representatives of the duty of supplying information in
this particular line of inquiry and insured the work being done better
than it could have been otherwise.</p>


<h3>DEMONSTRATING BOOTHS</h3>

<p class="noindent">were maintained in the California Building by a number of exhibitors
to whom we were pleased to give space for the purpose, as experience
teaches that one of the most effective ways of impressing the merits of
any particular article is to prove its value by sample. Our preserved
fruits, our canned mackerel and our borax products were shown and
sampled from artistic booths, while beans, wine, olive oil and other
products were demonstrated as occasion required but in a more modest
way.</p>


<h3>HOSTESSES.</h3>

<p>Mrs. Wiggins and Mrs. Filcher who had served so successfully as
hostesses at the St. Louis Exposition and at the Portland Exposition,
were installed as hostesses of the California Building at Seattle, the
compensation to be determined after the close of the Exposition when
our financial condition would be better understood, they agreeing in
advance to abide by the outcome. This arrangement was an incentive
to extra economy on their part, and it may be said they seconded every
effort of your Representatives in that direction, and yet they maintained
California&rsquo;s reputation for hospitality admirably, and became favorites
in the large Hostesses&rsquo; Association of the Exposition, of which Mrs.
Wiggins was one of the leading officials.</p>


<h3>SECRETARY.</h3>

<p>Mr. Geo. A. Dennison, who had a long prior record with the State
Board of Trade, and who served us so efficiently as Secretary at St. Louis
and at Portland, was appointed Secretary at Seattle, and remained with
us to the close of our work. In this connection it may be said that other
State Representatives had as their office force a secretary, a bookkeeper
and a stenographer. Mr. Dennison, possessing the qualifications, filled
all three of those positions for California, and being an expert in each
branch filled them all with marked efficiency.</p>


<h3>ATTENDANCE.</h3>

<p>The splendid exhibit made by California proved one of the principal
attractions of the Exposition. It became to be the general remark that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
if you did not see the Government exhibit and the California exhibit
you did not see the show. As a consequence all who attended the
Exposition visited the California building, and as may be supposed, we
had a crowd passing through the exhibits all the time the building was
open. The average attendance at the Exposition was close to 25,000
a day; allowing that each visitor spent two days on the grounds, and
that in one of the two days practically all visited our building, it may
be estimated that the number who inspected the California exhibits
daily was about 12,000. This we believe is a fair estimate.</p>


<h3>CALIFORNIA VISITORS.</h3>

<p>We had a separate card register for visitors from this State, and it
will surprise you perhaps to learn that the number of Californians who
registered with us averaged nearly two hundred a day, or twelve hundred
a week. In one day during the height of the season we registered
372 people from our home State. It is not only possible, but very
probable, that many come and went without registering; making
allowance for these, and figuring those who did register at 1,200 a week,
and counting twenty weeks for the Fair (19 weeks and 5 days to be
exact), we estimate the number of Californians who attended the Seattle
Exposition at 25,000.</p>


<h3>AWARDS.</h3>

<p>If other evidence were wanting to establish the claim that the
Seattle exhibit was the best and most complete ever made by California,
it would be found in the record of prizes won by this State. In
proportion to the number of entries we not only beat all the other
States in the number of high awards, but we beat all past records made
by California, and this in face of the fact that the juries as a rule set a
high standard and were very critical in their examinations. California&rsquo;s
greatest total premiums at any previous Exposition was 518, while at
Seattle the total was 800. To win gold medals or higher on half the
entries is considered a remarkable record, and yet out of the total of 800
at Seattle, 90 were grand prizes, an award only made in case of extraordinary
excellence, 414 were gold medals, 155 silver medals, 108 bronze
medals and 33 honorable mentions. A careful analysis by one who
understands what is required to win a high award at an International
Exposition and what it stands for, will show at once that this is a most
extraordinary record, one which we confidently believe has never been
equalled by any State or country at any Exposition in the world, and
one which is not likely to be equalled except possibly by California
itself, for many years to come. It will be noticed from the detailed list
of the awards, which follows in this report, that they are well distributed
throughout the State, nearly every locality and every industry
sharing in the honors, a further evidence of the representative character
of the exhibit.</p>


<h3>SALVAGE.</h3>

<p>At the close of the Exposition we took sufficient time to safely pack
all material that had to be returned and to label it carefully so as to
facilitate its distribution in California. In the meantime we sold some
of the edible goods and some on order we turned over to local agents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
of the owners. All money received therefor has been remitted to the
parties who furnished the articles and receipts received for the same.
The furniture, fixtures and other material which belonged to the State
and which we deemed it advisable to sell, was disposed of to the best
advantage possible, considering the great quantity of this class of goods
that were being thrown on the market. From this source we realized
the sum of $5,135.16. From rent of soft drink stand in the building we
realized the sum of $300.00, and from the sale of building $750.00,
making the total salvage exclusive of building $5,435.16, which is fully
accounted for in the financial statement which follows in this report.
The $750.00 received for the building was turned over to the State
Printer on account and never passed through our hands.</p>

<h3>MATERIAL ON HAND.</h3>

<p>There was certain office furniture which it was deemed unwise to
sacrifice, and some permanent exhibition material that is worth more
to the State for future expositions than any amount that could be
realized from it at a forced sale. Consequently this material was
returned and the furniture has been turned over to the State Agricultural
Society and the exhibition material has been stored in a shed
which we built for the purpose on the grounds of the State Agricultural
Society. The latter consists of eight mineral show cases, a collection
of California ores and mineral specimens, a large assortment of California
woods, including burls and rare specimens, a lot of framed and
unframed pictures of California scenes and industries, and about 500<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
glass jars, most of which are filled with seeds, cereals, sugar or processed
fruits. The furniture returned at 50 cents on the dollar, the
usual selling price at an Exposition of good material, is worth $75.00,
the showcases $425.00, exhibit material, estimated at half what it
would cost to collect it, $2,000.00, and the glass jars $1,000.00. This
totals a heritage to the State from the Seattle Exposition of $3,500.00.
This will be available and worth even more than the sum stated whenever
the State desires to make another exhibition.</p>


<h3>BENEFITS TO CALIFORNIA.</h3>

<p>Summing up the benefits of an exhibit is a good deal like a merchant
trying to estimate the good derived from a sign over his door.
Occasionally a patron may say, &ldquo;I saw your sign and came in,&rdquo; and
occasionally a party may say, &ldquo;I saw your exhibit and it prompted me
to come to California.&rdquo; The money dropped from travelers alone who
passed through this State going to or returning from the Exposition,
has probably recompensed California for its outlay, but this is only the
beginning of the harvest. Many people from the eastern and central
States who visited the Exposition with a view of ascertaining in which
part of the Northwest it would be best to settle, changed their minds
after seeing the exhibits made by the different States and came on to
California. Besides, thousands of others already settled, after inspecting
the exhibits made by this State, openly declared that if they ever
moved again they would land in California. The tons of literature on
this State carried away by visitors to supplement and strengthen their
impressions, both impressions and literature to be disseminated among
their neighbors, will have an effect that cannot be estimated, but which
must inevitably bear fruit for California for many years to come. Then
again, the seeing of our splendid products naturally excites a desire to
try them, and the increased demand for our fruits, oil, wines, etc.,
growing out of such a display, is far-reaching. But more than all this,
the greater intercourse, the better acquaintance, the more friendly feeling
between the people of the different sections of the country, and
particularly of the west, and more particularly between the people of
this State and Washington, or Oregon and Washington, if you please,
is bound to lead to a better understanding in regard to trade relations
and result in commercial benefits that cannot be estimated. That the
participation of California was wise there is no doubt, and that the
benefits received and to be received will be many fold greater than the
cost is as certain as the future. The follow-up letters that have already
come to your Representatives from people of the Northwest and other
sections who saw and inspected our exhibit, is further proof that an
interest in this State has been awakened among them that will not soon
die out.</p>


<h3>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.</h3>

<p>We are under obligations to so many that it would be tedious to
enumerate them. The higher officials of the Exposition, President
J. E. Chilberg, Director-General I. A. Nadeau and Director of Exhibits
H. E. Dosch, showed us every courtesy and manifested a desire to do
all they could to facilitate our work; while from the other departments,
and even from the subordinates in all departments, a request from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
California was promptly considered and always conceded when not
inconsistent with the Exposition rules. There were differences at first,
as is always the case, but on a better understanding these were adjusted
to the satisfaction of all concerned.</p>

</div>

<p>The Southern Pacific Company and the Northern Pacific Company
carried our freight at a one-way rate, and their respective agents were
prompt and accommodating, setting a new mark for railroad efficiency
at Expositions. The Southern Pacific Passenger Department also
loaned us some very fine pictures of California scenes which were valuable
not only as wall decorations but as object lessons on certain
features of our State. To the Golden Gate Park officials of San Francisco,
and also the officials of the Stockton State Hospital, we are under
obligations for liberal contributions of ornamental plants and shrubs
for the decoration of the California building and grounds. Mr. R. M.
Teague of San Dimas and the Fancher Creek Nursery of Fresno, also
contributed liberally of their choicest stock, for which we owe them a
debt of gratitude. The same is true of J. Dietrich, Howard &amp; Smith,
Elysian Park and Edward H. Rust, all of Los Angeles, and of the
Orange County Nursery &amp; Land Co., of Fullerton.</p>

<p>To the counties and other subdivisions of the State that through
organized effort and at their own expense collected valuable exhibition
material, prepared descriptive literature and sent representatives to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
Seattle, thereby strengthening the exhibit and adding to the force of
California workers, we are under obligations. To their efforts and to
the efficiency of the people they sent much of California&rsquo;s success at
the Seattle Exposition is due, and we want them to know and feel that
their efforts and co-operation are fully appreciated.</p>

<p>To producers, manufacturers and packers, to lumbermen and miners,
who responded to our request for samples of their output we owe a
debt which we tried to pay in part by caring for their goods as they
would have cared for them, and by looking out for their interests in the
matter of awards as carefully as they could have done had they been
there.</p>

<p>In this connection we wish to express our obligation to the Niles-Pease
Furniture Company for the generous loan of the finest art
mission furniture for our reception room, to Byron Mauzy of San
Francisco, the Star Piano Company and Salyer-Baumeister of Los
Angeles, for the loan of pianos for the use of our guests, and to the
Eilers Piano Company for the free use of a pianola for our lecture
room. To Arthur Harris, designer, and to C. L. Wilson, Superintendent
of Installation, both experts in their line, is due largely the attractive
character of California&rsquo;s exhibit, admitted to be the most beautiful
in arrangement and display, as well as the most comprehensive ever
put up by this or any other State, at Seattle or any other Exposition.</p>


<h3>CONCLUSION.</h3>

<p>We do not hesitate to affirm that California&rsquo;s participation at the
Seattle Exposition was a success from every point of view, and knowing
our trust was conscientiously performed, and that our best efforts
were exerted in the interest of our State, we dare to hope that you who
trusted us are not disappointed, and that the people of California who
generously advanced the money for the work are satisfied with the
showing made, and that they will reap substantial and lasting benefit
as the result of their enterprise and liberality. We want to thank you
sincerely for the confidence reposed in us, for your kindly co-operation
and advise, and particularly for the generous rein given to us in carrying
out a work for which you, in the eyes of the law, were primarily
responsible. Our studied efforts were continually directed toward
trying to get the greatest results at the least cost, for, though handling
a generous appropriation, we never lost sight of the fact that it was the
people&rsquo;s money, and consequently we consented to the expenditure of a
dollar only where in our judgement a dollar&rsquo;s worth or more benefit
would accrue to California; neither did we lose sight of the high
standard which has characterized your course in the handling of public
affairs. We acted on the principle that public office is a public trust,
and that public money should be handled with greater care than one
would handle his own.</p>

<p>The following pages contain a complete list of the awards made to
California exhibitors and a statement of all moneys received and expended,
and accompanying this report we hand you the vouchers showing
all our transactions and just how the money was expended. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
have settled every honorable claim, we have concluded the work in full,
even to the distribution of the awards, and if there is a dollar left to go
back into the Treasury it is because that dollar was not needed for the
full satisfaction of the duties imposed.</p>
